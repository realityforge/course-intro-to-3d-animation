# TODO

A simple way to keep track of work that I want to complete.

## General

* Consider having multiple versions of each model.
  These versions could be could be stored:
  - within a single file in different collections,
  - within different files in the same directory using some convention
  - within different files in different directories
  The variations being:
  - Modelled with Modifiers un-applied
  - Modelled and maybe sculpted
  - Materialized
  - Animated

## Modelling

* Add Seesaw Model
* Add some trees and/or bushes and/or mushrooms and/or flowers.

## Animation Ideas

### Idea 1

* There are two characters, the observer and the trickster.
* The observer is the party via which we experience the story.
* The trickster is the party which initiates the actions that the observer reacts to.
* A possible sequence:
  * The observer is swinging on the swing
  * The observer hops off and wanders along path to look at flowers
  * The observer sits on seat and starts to relax.
* We have a depth of field change where we move from the resting observer to a hand pushing the basketball from the top of the fort and then we zoom in to the ball as it starts moving
* the ball rolls down the slide.
* the ball bounces off the ground.
* the ball bounces off the merry-go-round (which starts the merry-go-round rotating).
* the ball bounces off the rocking horse (which makes the rocking horse start rocking).
* the ball bounces off the basketball backboard and through the hoop.
* The ball bounces itself to a stop on the court.
* During the ball sequence the camera Moves through a sequence of shots to show off the animation.
  - First the top of the slide
  - Then sideways as it bounces, then at each point of contact of ball with a different element.
    (If we can these would be separate cameras that are shown in same viewport - comic book style.
	We would also keep one panel viewing the observer and their reactions as it progresses)
  - Finally we end up with a wide of the whole scene.
* Then we zolly in on the observer as the observer expresses shock
* The observer gets up and wanders over to the ball, looks at it, shrugs.
* We see the observer approach the fort. (perhaps from above ?)
* We have a shot from inside the fort, looking out and we see the observer rise up to look in fort. Observer raises eyebrow and goes down.
* The observer wanders back to the chair.
* The closing shot is of the trickster lowering from the forts roof cavity and snickering.

### Idea 2

* The ball is the trickster. It can self bounce. The closing shot is off the ball opening it's eyes and winking at the camera.

### Idea 3

* The story of a ball that wants to go through a baskball hoop and tries successive sequences to get enough power to do so.
* The zolly occurs to the third party who is watching
