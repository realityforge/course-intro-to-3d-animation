# TODO

A simple way to keep track of work that I want to complete.

## General

* Figure out how the course expects us to arrange files on filesystem and adopt if useful
* Consider having multiple versions of each model.
  These versions could be could be stored:
  - within a single file in different collections,
  - within different files in the same directory using some convention
  - within different files in different directories
  The variations being:
  - Modelled with Modifiers un-applied
  - Modelled and maybe sculpted
  - Materialized
  - Animated

## Modelling

* Use Sculpting for rock-climbing wall in fort
* Add Swing Model
* Add Seesaw Model
* Add BasketBall Board/Ring
